-- Keeps open buffers in step with the files the agent edits.
--
-- The chat agent edits files on disk, not through nvim. It has an ACP path that would
-- reach the buffer instead — CodeCompanion implements fs/write_text_file, and its handler
-- writes into an open buffer when it finds one (interactions/chat/acp/fs.lua) — but
-- claude-agent-acp only ever defines writeTextFile on its client proxy and never calls it,
-- so that path is dead no matter what clientCapabilities advertise. The agent's own
-- Edit/Write tools go straight to the filesystem.
--
-- Nothing in nvim notices that on its own: `autoread` is off by default and only acts when
-- something calls `checktime`. So the buffer kept serving the pre-edit text while the file
-- underneath it had moved on — two versions of the same file, and whichever you saved won.
