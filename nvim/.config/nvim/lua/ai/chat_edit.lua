-- Editing a message that has already been sent, then asking again with it.
--
-- The transcript in the chat buffer is a rendering, not the record. An ACP agent keeps its own
-- copy of the conversation and form_messages (adapters/acp/helpers.lua) only ever forwards user
-- messages not yet marked sent, so text edited above the prompt reaches nobody; the HTTP adapters
-- send `chat.messages`, which add_message builds and nothing re-reads from the buffer. Reviving a
-- chat looks like the counter-example but runs the other way round — session/load asks the agent
-- to replay *its* memory to us, and ACP has no method for pushing ours back.
--
-- So an edit the user then asks about is answered with a session that has never seen the
-- conversation, carrying the edited one as its opening message. What that costs is said at the
-- prompt: the agent's past replies arrive as quoted text rather than as its own turns, and tool
-- calls in the transcript are prose, so there is no live tool state to resume.

---as usual, exactly as it would be on a chat that had never been edited.
---The name moves with the conversation, so it is taken off the session being left behind: that one

---worse than one of them falling back to the agent's own auto-title for it.
