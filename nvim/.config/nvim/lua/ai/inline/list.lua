-- whose diff nobody has decided on yet — with the keys to settle them from here.
--
-- Deliberately a float rather than a Telescope picker, unlike the chat list. This view redraws
-- itself while it is open, and Picker:refresh re-runs the finder, which re-selects the default
-- row — so a live list would drag the cursor off whatever was being read, ten times a second.
-- There is nothing to fuzzy-search either: a handful of rows at most, and they are picked out by
-- where they are rather than by name. Same float idiom as the status panel and the options step.
--
-- Settling a diff from here is safe because every step of it is buffer-scoped: codecompanion's
-- resolve_diff works on diff_ui.bufnr, DiffUI:close is a no-op for an inline diff, and our own
-- accept/reject handlers address the buffer explicitly. None of it reads the current window, so
-- the target buffer does not even have to be on screen.
