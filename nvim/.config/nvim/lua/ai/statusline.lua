-- The one always-visible signal that inline has something in play.

-- Everything else inline does is either where the edit is (marks, signs, the diff) or behind a key
-- (the list). Neither answers "did something arrive while I was in another file?", and a notify
-- does not either: there is no notification plugin here, so it is one line in the message area that
-- scrolls away. This segment is the standing answer, and it is empty whenever there is nothing to
-- say, so it costs nothing the rest of the time.

local M = {}

-- Ordered, because the segment reads left to right in the order things happen: sent, answered,
-- waiting on a decision, gave up.
